We welcome the recent formalization of the Casper CBC in Isabelle \cite{Nakamura}.
Our aproach resembles theirs from a high-level point of view; however, we try to keep the protocol as abstract as possible and formalize the results as close as possible to the ones in the Casper CBC white papers.
They only tackle the full-node version of Casper TFG and they formulate and prove for it a slightly different version of safety; in contrast, we prove safety, non-triviality, and string non-triviality for both the full-node and the light-node abstractions of Casper CBC.
On a more technical note, their definition of the full-node messages uses lists instead of sets of messages for justification, as using sets of messages because ``because sets can not be used for recursive definition'' \cite{Nakamura-github}; to capture the intended idea of sets we use a more involved definition for states and ensure that protocol states are always sorted.



To include: 
\begin{enumerate} 
	\item Compare/contrast with \cite{Nakamura}
	\item Areas for further refinement of abstraction
	\item Possibility of fitting other consensus protocols into our abstract type class hierarchy
\end{enumerate}
