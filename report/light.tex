Emphasis on explicating: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item why we no longer need least fixed point-based state definitions
	\item to the extent that it differs from the full node version, the strong non-triviality proof: atomic equivocation construction, pivotal validator proof, recursive atomic equivocation construction, overall proof sketch
\end{enumerate}
